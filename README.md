The OWServer Plugin for the Indigo Home Control Server (Indigo) is 
used to provide a bridge between the OW-SERVER line of products from 
[Embedded Data Systems](https://www.embeddeddatasystems.com) (EDS) 
and Indigo. The EDS OW-SERVER (OWS) line is a series of hardware 
bridges that connect 1-Wire networks to 1-Wire sensors in order to be read 
and controlled.

Note: The OWServer plugin does not require access to the Internet in 
order to work, but it does require access to the 1-Wire servers 
located on your Local Area Network. It may be possible to use the 
plugin with a WAN IP; however, the plugin was not designed to be 
used in this way. You should proceed with caution if attempting to 
communicate with WAN-based servers.

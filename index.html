<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    The OWServer Plugin for the Indigo Home Control Server (Indigo) is used to provide a bridge between the OW-SERVER line of products from
    <a href="https://www.edsproducts.com">Embedded Data Systems</a> (EDS) and Indigo. The EDS OW-SERVER (OWS) line is a series of hardware bridges that connect 1-Wire networks to 1-Wire
    sensors to be read and controlled.
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<img class="TextWrap" src="img/img_pluginConfigDialog.png">
<p>
    Installing the OWServer Plugin is accomplished in the same way that you would install other Indigo plugins. There are no additional steps or other Python packages that need to be
    installed. From the computer where the Indigo Server resides (you can’t directly install plugins from a client machine), download the current plugin archive from the Indigo File
    Library and then double-click on the archive file. Indigo will prompt you to install the plugin. Once the plugin has been successfully installed, you will need to configure the
    plugin to work with your 1-Wire network. During installation, Indigo should present you with the Plugin Configuration dialog. If for some reason that doesn’t happen, or if you want
    to make additional changes later, you can always get to the Plugin Configuration dialog by going to the Indigo main menu and selecting Plugins —> OWServer —> Configure…
</p>
<p>
    All settings that affect the plugin’s overall operations are found in the Plugin Configuration dialog. The settings are divided into four sections: Server Settings, Display Settings,
    Plugin Update Notification Settings, and Debug Settings. Let’s look at each of these in turn.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Server Settings</span>
        <p>
            The OWServer Plugin is designed to automatically detect your OWS as long as it’s installed on your network in a place where Indigo can see it (if you have more than one
            server, the plugin should be able to detect all of them.) To enable automatic detection, tick the Auto Detect Servers? checkbox. This will invoke a process whereby the plugin
            will call-out to your network and ask all OWS servers to identify themselves. If this operation is successful, the plugin will automatically manage communication with all of
            your server instances. If you add an additional server to your network, the plugin is designed to automatically make it available. If for some reason the automatic detection
            is unsuccessful, or if you’d rather manually identify your servers, you can enter the IP address(es) of your OWS. Simply enter the IP addresses into the Server IP Address(es)
            textfield, and separate each address with a comma. If you have checked the Auto Detect Servers? checkbox, any information that you have typed in the Server IP Address(es)
            textfield will be ignored (you can leave the field populated if you wish.) The plugin also controls how frequently Indigo will reach out to your OWS to download new data. Set
            this frequency in the Polling Interval drop-down menu. The value of this setting depends largely on the size of your network. For example, polling intervals of 15 seconds may
            be ambitious for larger networks (especially if an entire plugin cycle is near or greater than 15 seconds long.) If you see strange behavior—such as the plugin getting stuck
            into a loop where it never seems to stop updating—try increasing the time between polls. Lastly, we want to allow for the possibility that your OWS won’t respond to a
            particular request. This is unlikely, but we don’t want the plugin to wait forever either. Select your preferred wait time in the Server Timeout drop-down menu. This will
            close the socket that has been opened to the OWS if it doesn’t reply by the chosen timeout.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Display Settings</span>
        <p>
            OWServer Plugin Display Settings control how information is visually displayed throughout Indigo. First, select whether you prefer temperatures to be displayed in Fahrenheit
            or Celsius using the Temperatures drop-down menu. You can control the level of data precision that is displayed by using the Display Precision drop-down menus. These settings
            affect how many decimal places are shown throughout the Indigo interface. The settings do not affect the underlying data. There are drop-down menus to select settings for
            Humidex, Humidity, Temperatures, Pressures and Voltages. Lastly, you can choose to suppress most log messages by ticking the Suppress Results Logging checkbox. Checking this
            box will minimize the number of messages sent to the log; however, occasional general messages and all error messages will still be displayed.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Plugin Update Notifications</span>
        <p>
            If you would like to be notified via email when updates to the plugin become available, tick the box next to Email Plugin Update Notifications and enter a valid email
            address. Note: this requires that you also have Indigo configured to send email messages as the plugin interfaces with that facility rather than sending emails on its own. I
            won’t know what information you enter here (I don’t collect any information on your use of the plugin whatsoever) unless you send it to me in a debug log for troubleshooting
            purposes. This communication occurs solely between your Indigo installation and your email provider.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Debugging</span>
        <p>
            If things aren’t working the way that you expect them to, turning on the debugging facility within the plugin can help us isolate the cause, and the output is tremendously
            useful when reporting bugs. There are three levels of debug logging—Low, Medium and High. Selecting Low, provides a minimal amount of debug logging (still a lot, really.)
            Medium provides for a pretty massive amount of logging (but keeps all sensitive data like IP addresses, ROM ID values, and email address from being displayed.) A setting of
            High will allow this sensitive information to be logged, so use with care when posting log results to a public place.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    That’s the extent of the settings that affect the overall operation of the plugin. But we’re still not done setting up our OWServer Plugin implementation. Now we must create devices.
    Otherwise, what’s the point of coming this far? But first, let’s discuss the OWServer Plugin menu.
</p>

<h3 style="clear:both">Menu Items</h3>
<p><img class="TextWrap" src="img/img_pluginMenuItems.png">
    There are many functions that can be accessed through the OWServer Plugin Menu.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Enable/Disable All OWServer Devices</span>
        <p>
            Selecting either of these two menu items will turn communication on or off for all OWServer devices at once. This is useful when trying to isolate problems. For example,
            making it easier to disable all and then re-enable one-by-one.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Check for Plugin Updates</span>
        <p>
            Use this function to check for plugin updates manually. This option does not require you to enable email notification on the Plugin Configuration menu or have email features
            turned on within Indigo. The results of this check will be printed to the Indigo log.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Refresh All Sensors Now</span>
        <p>
            Use this function to initiate a sensor refresh cycle immediately. This is essentially equivalent to allowing the plugin to update on its own. Selecting this function will not
            affect the timing of the next scheduled data refresh cycle.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Send Command to 1-Wire Device</span>
        <p>
            Use this function to send a one-time command to a 1-Wire device via the OWServer Sensor Command Framework (see Communicating Directly with a 1-Wire Device below.)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Test Server Communication</span>
        <p>
            Use this function to test communication with your OWS. Select the server you want to test from the Server IP drop-down menu and click Execute. You can also choose to dump the
            XML to the log if you wish.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Toggle Debugging</span>
        <p>
            Use this function to turn debugging on or off. If turning debug logging on, the debug level will be set to the current debug level preference listed under the Plugin
            Configuration options dialog.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Devices</h3>
<p>
    OWServer devices are where most of the plugin’s magic happens. There are myriad device types that the OWS will support—but be forewarned, the OWS (and therefore the OWServer Plugin)
    does not directly support all the possible 1-Wire devices that you might come across. You will see some using 1-Wire sensors with great success through the use of Arduino boards for
    example, but these sensors are not necessarily compatible with the OWS. Your safest bet is to refer to the EDS website which lists all of the the sensors that the OWS officially
    supports. Fortunately, the OWServer Plugin supports many device types natively within the Indigo environment. Each device type has a custom-tailored configuration dialog that
    contains settings specific to the OWS implementation for that individual type of sensor. As usual, we start by creating a new Indigo device, selecting OWServer as the Device Type.
    Next, select the Device Model drop-down menu and the list of currently support sensors will appear. The list of sensors is arranged by model number for easy identification
    (Maxim/Dallas model numbers followed by EDS model numbers.)
</p>
<p>
    In order to get the most out of the plugin, you should select the sensor device that’s most appropriate to the device that you have connected to your 1-Wire network. Unsurprisingly,
    some of the EDS sensors are based on Maxim/Dallas chips that the plugin also supports natively. In those instances, you should always select the EDS model number and not the
    Maxim/Dallas number. That way, you can be sure that you are getting all of the supports for the additional features of the EDS sensor (like LED, optional relay, etc.) Once you have
    selected the appropriate device type, you should select Edit Device Settings…
</p>
<p>
    Selecting the Edit Device Settings… button will cause the device’s custom-tailored configuration dialog to appear. The available options will vary based on the type of device
    selected. Sometimes, options will appear that may not be present on your specific device. For example, relay settings may appear even though you have a device without the optional
    relay. The following devices are presently supported in the OWServer Plugin:
</p>
<p>
    Presently, the plugin contains functionality for many 1-Wire devices including:
</p>
<ul>

    <li><img class="TextWrap" src="img/img_edsServer.png">
        <span>EDS 1-Wire Server (OW-SERVER-ENET 1, 2 and WiFi)</span>
        <p>
            There is an OWServer Plugin device type that represents OWS units. By creating a Server Device and selecting the relevant IP address, you will be presented with a device that
            shows information regarding the server itself including health, power, number of connected sensors and so on. One use for a Server Device type is to help identify
            communication errors on your network. Each server reports device communication errors—separately by communication channel if so equipped—which can help isolate trouble. If
            you see owsDataErrors or owsDataErrorsChannelx, these are errors in your 1-Wire network, not in the plugin or the communication between the plugin and the OWS.

    <li><img class="TextWrap" src="img/img_ds18b20.png">
        <span>Dallas DS18B20 Temperature Sensor</span>
        <p>
            The DS18B20 is a simple 9-bit to 12-bit temperature sensor. It reports little beyond temperature. Select the relevant IP address from the Server IP drop-down menu. Likewise,
            select the relevant ROM ID for your sensor using the Sensor ID drop-down menu. Lastly, you can set an optional temperature offset to account for the possibility that your
            sensor isn’t reporting temperature accurately. In most cases, you won’t need to use this feature; however, it’s provided as a convenience. The adjustment factor is in degrees
            Celsius. If you are reporting temperatures in Celsius, simply add a positive or negative value to adjust the temperature up or down (for example, -0.5 or +1.0). If you are
            reporting values in Fahrenheit, for every 1 degree Celsius temperature adjustment, your temperature will be adjusted 1.8° F. Enter the adjustment factor in the Temperature
            Adjustment textfield. Lastly, there are two writeable variable values [UserByte1] and [UserByte2]. These two fields are two bit registers, and they are non-volatile. Note:
            these values are not writeable from the configuration dialog box, but they are writeable from several other places via the OWServer Sensor Command Framework. More on that
            later. Because the sensor reports little beyond temperature, there is no need to provide any alternatives for a Primary Sensor Value (unlike most of the other devices below.)

        <span>Dallas DS18S20 Temperature Sensor</span>
        <p>
            The DS18S20 is a simple temperature sensor. It reports little beyond temperature. Select the relevant IP address from the Server IP drop-down menu. Likewise, select the

    <li><img class="TextWrap" src="img/img_ds2406.png">
        <span>Dallas DS2406 Dual Switch Plus Memory</span>
        <p>
            The DS2406 is a dual switch that also contains a memory function. The DS2406 Dual Addressable Switch Plus Memory offers a simple way to remotely control a pair of open drain
            transistors and to monitor the logic level at each transistor’s output via the 1-Wire bus for closed loop control. The sensor reports several pieces of information about the
            states of the transistors in the form of Input Level, Flip Flop, Activity Latch, and will respond to an Activity Latch Reset command. In addition, according to Maxim,
            individual devices will respond to a Conditional Search command if they qualify for certain user-specified conditions, which include the state of the output transistor, the
            static logic level or a voltage transition at the transistor’s output. Select the relevant IP address from the Server IP drop-down menu. Likewise, select the relevant ROM ID
            for your sensor using the Sensor ID drop-down menu. There are a couple options for Primary Sensor Value: Input A or Input B. There are settings to set the operational state
            of the Flip Flop A and Flip Flop B—to either off (the default) or on (conducting.)

        <span>Dallas DS2408 8-Channel Addressable Switch</span>
        <p>
            The DS2408 is an 8-channel, Programmable Input/Output (PIO) 1-Wire chip. PIO outputs are configured as open-drain and provide an on resistance of 100Ω max. A robust PIO
            channel-access communication protocol ensures that PIO output-setting changes occur error-free. A data-valid strobe output can be used to latch PIO logic states into external
            circuitry such as a D/A converter (DAC) or microcontroller data bus. The DS2408 also supports conditional search capability based on PIO conditions or power-on-reset
            activity; the conditions to cause participation in the conditional search are programmable. The DS2408 has an optional VCC supply connection. When an external supply is
            absent, device power is supplied parasitically from the 1-Wire bus. When an external supply is present, PIO states are maintained in the absence of the 1-Wire bus power
            source.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select the relevant IP address from the Server IP drop-down menu. Likewise, select the relevant ROM ID for your sensor using the Sensor ID drop-down menu. The Primary Sensor
            Value can be configured to represent one of the eight channels (enumerated as 0 - 7). There are several writeable data variables displayed, although it should be noted that
            these values are not writeable from this interface. Additionally, you can configure the Power On Reset Latch to either reset
            state (or not as the case may be) on loss of power.

        <p>
            The DS2423 is a simple four channel counter—two of which have external trigger inputs called A and B. Each of the counters is associated with a memory page. A counter without
            external trigger input increments each time data is written to the page it is associated with (write cycle counter). The counters triggered by inputs A and B, respectively,
            increment with every low-going pulse on their input. All counters are read only. They are automatically cleared after power loss.

        <p>
            Select the relevant IP address from the Server IP drop-down menu. Likewise, select the relevant ROM ID for your sensor using the Sensor ID drop-down menu. For now, there is

        <span>Dallas DS2438 Smart Battery Monitor</span>
        <p>
            The DS2438 Smart Battery Monitor provides several functions that are desirable to carry in a battery pack: a means of tagging a battery pack with a unique serial number, a
            direct-to-digital temperature sensor which eliminates the need for thermistors in the battery pack, an A/D converter which measures the battery voltage and current, an
            integrated current accumulator which keeps a running total of all current going into and out of the battery, an elapsed time meter, and 40 bytes of nonvolatile EEPROM memory
            for storage of important parameters such as battery chemistry, battery capacity, charging methodology and assembly date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select the relevant IP address from the Server IP drop-down menu. Likewise, select the relevant ROM ID for your sensor using the Sensor ID drop-down menu. For now, there is
            only one Primary Sensor Value custom setting, which allows for display of the Temperature value as the Primary Sensor Value for the Indigo UI, however, if there is demand,
            Vdd, Vad, Vsense and Humidity could be added. Humidity is tricky because the DS2438 doesn’t report “actual” humidity and calculating actual humidity
            is somewhat of a black art.

    <li><img class="TextWrap" src="img/img_ds2450.png">
        <span>Dallas DS2450 Quad Converter</span>
        <p>
            The DS2450 1-Wire Quad A/D Converter is based on a successive-approximation analog to digital converter with a four to one analog multiplexer. Each input channel has its own
            register set to store the input voltage range, resolution, and alarm threshold values as well as flags to enable participation of the device in the conditional search if the
            input voltage leaves the specified range. Two alarm flags for each channel indicate if the voltage measured was too high or too low without requiring the bus master to do the
            comparison. Each A/D conversion is initiated by the bus master. A channel not used as analog input can serve as a digital open-drain output. After disabling the input the bus
            master can directly switch on or off the open-drain transistor at the selected channel. All device settings are stored in SRAM and kept non-volatile while the device gets
            power either through the 1-Wire bus or through its Vcc pin. After powering up, a power-on reset flag signals the bus master the need to restore the device settings before the
            regular operation can resume.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select the relevant IP address from the Server IP drop-down menu. Likewise, select the relevant ROM ID for your sensor using the Sensor ID drop-down menu. The Primary
            Sensor Value setting allows for display of the Conversion Value for Channels A - D for the Indigo UI. All other sensor values are retained and can be referred to in
            scripts, triggers, actions and control pages. If you would like to have more than one primary sensor value, merely create another instance of the device (same IP and
            ROM ID) and select a second primary sensor value. This allows you to be able to display any channel in the Indigo UI.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the settings above, there are two other settings related to all channels on the device. Power on Reset controls whether the state of the device will
            reset after power loss. As long as this bit is set the device will always respond to the Conditional Search command in order to notify the bus master that the control
            and threshold data is no longer valid. It is possible for the bus master to write the Power on Reset bit to a 1. This will make the device participate in the
            conditional search but will not generate a reset cycle. All device settings are stored and kept non-volatile while the device gets power either through the 1-Wire bus
            or through its Vcc pin.</p>
        <p>
            There are four sensor information blocks that contain information and controls for each of the four channels. They display read-only information regarding writeable
            variables, the current value of each variable and, where appropriate a button to enable or disable Output and Output Control.

        <p>
            The EDS0064 Temperature Sensor with Counter is a part of the EDS OW-ENV line of environmental sensors (EDS0064-EDS0068). The 32-bit counters (there are two) will increment
            approximately once per second and will reset upon power loss. The device is also offered with an optional relay. The optional relay is a latching relay; it will retain its
            state when power is lost. The states of the LED and the relay are nonvolatile; their states will be restored at power-up.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Primary Sensor Value will control what is shown in the Indigo Item List. The control allows you to display the Temperature, the value of Counter 1 and Counter 2,
            the LED State or the Relay State. All other sensor values are retained and can be referred to in scripts, triggers, actions and control pages. If you would like to
            have more than one primary sensor value, merely create another instance of the device (same IP and ROM ID) and select a second primary sensor value. This allows you
            to be able to display both a temperature device and a humidity device (for example.)
        </p>
        <p>The LED Function and Relay Function drop-down menus control how the sensor reacts to system inputs. There are four possible settings:
        <ol>

            <li>On with alarms / off with clear alarms command. [1]</li>

            <li>Always off. [3]</li>
        </ol>

            There is one sensor information block that contains information and controls for Temperature. It displays read-only information regarding writeable variables, the
            current value of each variable, a Temperature Adjustment textfield and, where appropriate, a button to clear Conditional Search States. In most cases, you won’t need
            to use the Temperature Adjustment feature; however, it’s provided as a convenience. The adjustment factor is in degrees Celsius. If you are reporting temperatures in
            Celsius, simply add a positive or negative value to adjust the temperature up or down (for example, -0.5 or +1.0). If you are reporting values in Fahrenheit, for
            every 1 degree Celsius temperature adjustment, your temperature will be adjusted 1.8° F. Enter the adjustment factor in the Temperature Adjustment textfield. (See
            Conditional Search States for More Information.) Finally, there is a Clear Sensor Alarms button which will clear all sensor alarms. It is not possible to clear
            individual alarms so this is not an option within the OWServer Plugin. Clicking this button will set all alarm variables for the device to zero (no alarm) and will
            apply the change to the requesting device only.

            sensor value. This allows you to be able to display both a temperature device and a humidity device (for example.) The device is also available with an optional relay. The
            optional relay is a latching relay; it will retain its state when power is lost. The states of the LED and the relay are nonvolatile; their states will be restored at
            power-up.

            There are four input information blocks that contain information and controls for each of the various inputs. They display read-only information regarding writeable
            variables, the current value of each variable and, where appropriate a button to clear Conditional Search States. (See Conditional Search States for More Information.)
            Finally, there is a Clear Sensor Alarms button which will clear all sensor alarms. It is not possible to clear individual alarms so this is not an option within the OWServer
            Plugin. Clicking this button will set all alarm variables for the device to zero (no alarm) and will apply the change to the requesting device only.

    </li>
    <li><span>Optional Relays</span>
        <p>
            Many of the EDS devices are provided with an option to include a latching relay. In many control dialogs, you will be presented with relay controls whether or not a relay
            exists in your instance of the device. It is a future enhancement plan to exclude those controls unless a user specifically indicates that the relay is present on the device.
            There is no concern however if you don’t have a relay. The OWS will simply send out the relay command and it will fall on deaf ears. When the relay function is populated on
            the EDS Sensors there will be a 4 Channel screw-down terminal. The individual connections (C, NO, NC, GND) will be labeled on the PCB Board. Since the relay is a latching
            relay NO and NC terminals have the opposing states. The screw-down labeled C is the connection for the power source of the NO & NC terminals.

<p>The plugin supports multiple servers--and a theoretically unlimited number of devices.
<ol>
    <li>Within the plugin preferences, enter the IP number(s) of the server(s) you want to use. The plugin has the ability to auto-detect servers, so you may want to try this feature
        first. If auto-detect is selected, the manually-entered list of IP addresses will be ignored.
    </li>
    <li>To get the most out of the plugin, you should create a set of devices. It is recommended that you create a server device which you can use to monitor the health of your EDS
        server. You should also create a 1-Wire device to track the information reported by that device for use in Indigo.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<img class="TextWrap" src="img/img_pluginActionItems.png">
<p>
    There are two action items defined within the plugin:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Refresh All Sensors</span>
        <p>
            Select the Refresh All Sensors Action Item to cause every 1-Wire sensor on your network to be polled.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Send Command to 1-Wire Device</span>
        <p>
            Select Send Command to 1-Wire Device to send a custom command to the 1-Wire device of your choice. When you select this item, you will be presented with a configuration
            dialog that will require four pieces of information to be entered:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the IP address of the server where the sensor resides,</li>
            <li>the ROM ID address of the sensor itself,</li>
            <li>the name of the variable that you want to adjust, and</li>
            <li>the value that you want to write to the variable.<br></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Triggers</h3>
<p>There are presently no custom triggers defined by the plugin.
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communicating Directly with a 1-Wire Device, Scripting and Technical Details</h3>
<p>
    Communicating directly with 1-Wire devices (for example, to set an alarm value) is both desirable and possible with the OWServer Sensor Command Framework. There are essentially three
    ways that you can accomplish this:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>You can use the OWServer Plugin Settings Menu to initiate a one-time command to a sensor. From the Plugin Settings Menu select Send Command to 1-Wire Device. A dialog box will
        appear that will facilitate the operation. You will need to know four pieces of information:
        <ol>
            <li>the IP address of the server where the sensor resides,</li>
            <li>the ROM ID address of the sensor itself,</li>
            <li>the name of the variable that you want to adjust, and</li>
            <li>the value that you want to write to the variable.<br></li>

        </ol>
    <li>You can send a command to a sensor on a routine basis by initiating an Indigo Action Item. An example of this would be by using an Indigo Trigger.
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new Indigo Trigger.</li>
            <li>Set the Trigger and the Condition(s) like you normally would for any Trigger.</li>
            <li>Select the Action “Send Command to 1-Wire Device.”</li>
            <li>Complete the Send Command to 1-Wire Device communication dialog as described in item 1 above.</li>

        </ol>
        <br></li>
    <li>You can send a command to a sensor using a Python script. You’re on your own with respect to writing the script as a whole, but here is the helpful block of code that you will
        need to interface with the OWServer Sensor Command Framework. You need the same four pieces of information, only now you send them as a part of a payload dictionary.
        <br><br><img src="img/img_scriptingPlugin.png">
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    As noted above, you can write values to individual sensor parameters to cause various things to take place. Below is a list of all of the variables to which you can write data, and
    information about valid parameter values (and their meaning.) These values are not writeable from configuration dialog boxes, but they are writeable from several other places via the
    OWServer Sensor Command Framework (see Communicating Directly with 1-Wire Devices.)
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span>Activity Latch Reset</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Resets the Activity Latch. Writing a 1 to this variable will reset the latch.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Alarm Values</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: ] - The OWServer Plugin allows you to set alarm values for sensors that support them. There are usually (always?) High and Low Alarm Values. The purpose of
            the alarm is to alert you when a condition (high or low) has been exceeded. You can set alarm values for sensors that support them by sending a 1-Wire Command to the sensor.
            For example: (When the sensor temperature exceeds 50 °C, an alarm will be tripped. When writing to a sensor, omit the ‘[‘ and ‘]’.)

    </li>

    <li><span>Alarm States</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Alarm states indicate that a corresponding alarm value has been exceeded (above the high alarm value or below the low alarm value.) When this
            occurs, the device’s corresponding [xxxxxxHighAlarmState] will be set to 1.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Calibration Key</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: ] - Calibration Key information coming soon.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Clear Alarms</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Sending the Clear Alarms command will reset all alarms associated with the device (it’s not presently possible in the 1-Wire framework to be able to
            clear individual alarms.) To send a clear alarms command, either select “Clear Sensor Alarms” within a device’s configuration dialog, or by sending a sensor’s [ClearAlarms]
            variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clearing alarms has the ability to affect relay state and LED state depending on how they are configured. Additional information on the possible effects is available in Relay
            and LED and/or Conditional Search sections of the manual.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Conditional Search States</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: ] - There are two types of search commands. A normal search command performs a search with all devices participating. The alarm or conditional search
            command performs a search with only the devices that are in some sort of alarm state. This reduces the search pool to quickly respond to devices that need attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            The OWServer Plugin does not currently support conditional searches natively, but that is hopefully that I’ll be able to add in a future enhancement. Until then, the OWServer
            Plugin does report conditional search states and provides a facility to clear conditional search states if desired. To clear conditional search states, either open a device’s
            configuration dialog and select “Clear [High/Low] Conditional Search State”.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Conversion Range</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: ] - Conversion Range information coming soon.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Conversion Resolution</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: ] - Conversion Resolution information coming soon.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Flip Flops</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - The channel flip-flops are accessible through the OWServer Plugin. The power-on default for the conditional search settings and the channel
            flip-flops is all 1’s. Setting a channel flip-flop to 0 will make the associated PIO-transistor conducting or on; setting the flip-flop to 1 will switch the transistor off,
            which is identical to the power-on default.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>LED Function</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1, 2, 3] - The LED Function Value controls the operation of the LED (if so equipped.) There are four possible settings:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On with alarms / off with no alarms. [0]</li>
            <li>On with alarms / off with clear alarms command. [1]</li>
            <li>On / off under command. [2]</li>
            <li>Always off. [3]</li>
        </ol>

    <li><span>LED State</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - The current state of the LED (off [0], on [1]) The state of the LED is stored in non-volatile memory and is restored at power-up. Since the relay is
            latching, its state remains the same, even when power is removed.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Output Enable</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Output Control (OC) and Output Enable (OE) control the alternate use of a channel as output. For normal operation as analog input the OE bit of a
            channel needs to be 0, rendering the OC bit to a don’t care. With OE set to 1, a 0 for OC will make the channel’s output transistor conducting, a 1 for OC will switch the
            transistor off. With a pullup resistor to a positive voltage, for example, the OC bit will directly translate into the voltage equivalent of its logic state. Enabling the
            output does not disable the analog input. Conversions remain possible, but will result in values close to 0 if the transistor is conducting.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Output Control</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Output Control (OC) and Output Enable (OE) control the alternate use of a channel as output. For normal operation as analog input the OE bit of a
            channel needs to be 0, rendering the OC bit to a don’t care. With OE set to 1, a 0 for OC will make the channel’s output transistor conducting, a 1 for OC will switch the
            transistor off. With a pullup resistor to a positive voltage, for example, the OC bit will directly translate into the voltage equivalent of its logic state. Enabling the
            output does not disable the analog input. Conversions remain possible, but will result in values close to 0 if the transistor is conducting.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Output State</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Outputs are open collector MOSFET transistors with unidirectional overvoltage TVS diodes (48 volt). When the output state is high, the transistor is
            off. If there is pull-up current (such as a pull-up resistor), a voltmeter will read high. When the output state is low, the transistor is on and the output will read low.
            Note that if there is no pull-up current, the output may be off, but a voltmeter will not read high.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>PIO Activity Latch State</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0-255] - The PIO Activity Latch State contains a value that represents the activity latch state of each of the DS2408’s 8 I/O channels. The OWServer Plugin
            takes the single value between 0-255 and imputes the activity latch state of each I/O (Note: this state is not available as of v0.8.00 of the plugin. It will be available in
            a future version of the plugin.)
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>PIO Output Latch State</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0-255] - The PIO Output Latch State contains a value that represents the state of each of the DS2408’s 8 I/O channels. The OWServer Plugin takes the single
            value between 0-255 and imputes the state of each I/O.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Power On Reset</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Sets the sensor to reset after poser loss (once power has been restored.) To set the sensor to reset after power loss, write a value of [1] to this
            variable.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Power On Reset Latch</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Resets the latch state upon power loss. When power is restored, the latch will be reset.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Pulldown State</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Each pin has a 1.5k Ohm, 0.5 Watt pull-down resistor which may be turned on using the Pull-down value byte(location 91). Setting a bit high turns
            off the pull-down, low turns it on. This resistor may be used to read contact closures, simply connect one end of the contact to a voltage (i.e. 5, 12 or 25 volts) and the
            other end to the input pin. When the contact is closed, the input will read a 1, when it is open the pull-down resistor will cause it to read 0. The pull-down resistor should
            be turned off when a channel is being used as an output.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Pulse Counter Reset</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - Resets the value of the pulse counter. To reset the pulse counter, write a value of [1] to this variable.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>Relay Function</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1, 2, 3] - The Relay Function Value controls the operation of the Relay (if so equipped.) There are four possible settings:
        </p>

    <li><span>Relay State</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - The current state of the relay (unlatched [0], latched [1]) The state of the Relay is stored in non-volatile memory and is restored at power-up.
            Since the relay is latching, its state remains the same, even when power is removed.

    </li>

    <li><span>RSTZ Configuration</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1] - The RSTZ signal is configurable to serve as either a hard-wired reset for the PIO output or as a strobe for external circuitry to indicate that a
            PIO write or PIO read has completed. This setting configures RSTZ as either RST input [0] or STRB [1].
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><span>RTD Read Delay</span>
        <p>
            [Possible Values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] - RTD (resistance temperature detectors) are used to measure temperature by correlating the resistance of the RTD element with
            temperature. Most RTD elements consist of a length of finely coiled wire wrapped around a ceramic or glass core. The element is typically fragile; therefore, it’s often
            protected inside a more durable probe for protection. The temperature element is made pure metal, most commonly platinum, nickel or copper. The material has a predictable
            change in resistance as the temperature changes and it is this predictable change that is used to determine temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the RTD element is to be read, a current source of 420 μAmp is turned on, then the device is read, and then the current source is turned off (unless the RTD Read Delay
            is zero, in which case the current source is on all the time). The current source is on about 1 second for each read, plus 1.6 seconds, of the RTD element. Without any delay
            programmed, reads occur continuously. With a 1 programmed, reads occur about every 2.6 seconds. Delays and duty cycles are related as follows:

<h3>Framework</h3>
<p>
    The framework of the entire plugin environment as it relates to Indigo is very straightforward. Indigo talks through the plugin to the OWS which in turn talks to the 1-Wire network.
    Communication is bi-directional, and presently happens through routine calls to the OWS via [HTTP Get] commands. This communication via Indigo doesn’t preclude communication with the
    1-Wire network by other means (such as via a direct browser session.) Users choose a predefined polling interval through the plugin, the plugin reaches out to the OWS and either
    requests data from it or sends data to it, interprets the results and passes the results back to user-defined OWServer devices (Indigo Custom Devices.) The plugin is also scriptable.

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>
    This plugin is designed to work with Indigo 6.0 and above and is therefore compatible with Python 2.6. I will do my best to account for other implementations where possible, but
    sometimes I will not be able to do that when it would cause a loss of functionality or break existing frameworks. I will also work to continue to keep the plugin current as Indigo,
    its Python implementation and EDS’ firmware versions evolve over time.

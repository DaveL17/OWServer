- Adds config setting for sensors with/without optional relay.
- Adds temperature adjustment field to allow for fine-tuning
  sensor temperature values (value in °C.) For example, entering a
  value of -1 will adjust the temperature reading by -1°C or by -1.8°F.
- Adds Indigo Action item to update all sensor devices.
- Adds Indigo Action item to send command to a 1-Wire device.
- Adds Indigo Menu item to send command to a 1-Wire device.
- Updates DS2408 to allow selection of switches 0-7 as the primary
  sensor display value.
- Implements Indigo custom device state icons for all switches,
  relays, and LED states to reflect on or off.
- Fixes bug where some devices did not properly track LED and Relay
  states.
- Moves server communication test from plugin configuration menu to
  the Indigo plugin menu (reduces clicks to run the test) and allows
  user to send XML output to the Indigo log (useful when trouble-
  shooting problems.)
- Reorders sensor list by sensor number rather than name for easier
  identification.
- Code enhancements:
    - Fixes some device state data types.
    - Simplifies configuration validation code.
    - Simplifies data parsing routines.
    - Standardizes device display preferences. May require users to
      reselect default display value for some devices.

v0.7.02
- Refines logging of device update status for OW-Server-ENET (Rev. 1)
- Refines device states to account for differences in OW-Server_ENET
  (Rev 1 and Rev 2) servers.
- Refines compliance with PEP8.

v0.7.01
- Adds uniform support for OWSERVER-ENET version 1 server.
- Adds support for EDS0067 Temperature and Light.
- Adds menu items to enable/disable all OWS devices.
- Adds Indigo custom device icon enumeration
      (device list, Indigo Touch, etc.)
- Adds configuration option to suppress results logging (still logs
  errors.)
- Code Refinements:
    - Refines configuration dialogs.
    - Improves Unicode support.
    - Increases compliance with PEP8.
    - Updates plugin to use Python 2.6 as default.
    - Moves parsing to methods for each type of sensor.
    - Improves debug logging implementation.
    - Minor improvement to built-in timer accuracy.
- Fixes bug in display precision routine.
- Fixes bug where new (unconfigured) devices are reported as being
  offline.
- Fixes bug in debug logging.

v0.7.0
- WARNING! This update may require users to delete and reassign all
  existing sensor devices.
	- Adds a new device type to represent the OW server itself.
	- Significant rewrite of device code including support for numerous
      new sensor types.
	- Implements new device features including: greater use of device
      controls where appropriate: UI state values, on/off state, etc.
	- Adds user control over which device state to display in the item
      list and under the state "sensorValue" -- this applies only to
      devices where the choice is appropriate.
	- Adds menu item to provide for instantaneous refresh of device
      states (sensor values) which is under: "Refresh Sensors Now..."
	- All sensors update after configuration dialog closed with 'Save'.
	- Adds debug levels -- Low, Medium, High.
	- Many, many code refinements.

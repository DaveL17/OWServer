OWServer Plugin - Developed by: DaveL17

ToDo before v1.0:

- Hide Temperature Adjustment field on EDS0071.

- Expand DS2408 to include imputed values for PIOActivityLatchState (done
  in the same way as PIOOutputLatchSate.)

- Add Conditional Search State buttons to EDS0071.

- Consider hiding states that don't need to be displayed (i.e., clearAlarms)

- Skip devices that are not dev.enabled == false (rather than sleep.)

- Error checking on device config inputs.
- Error checking on Action Item inputs.

- Set up standard devices for LED, Relay, etc.
    - Pick an IP.
    - Pick a ROM ID.
    - That's all.

- Indicate in the Indigo UI that an alarm state exists? How to
  distinguish between an alarm state and a plugin error state?

- What happens when a known server is taken down (both with auto
  enabled and disabled.)
  - Also test what happens when IP of a server changes (DHCP).

  for starters, this:
        Oct 14, 2015, 7:51:44 PM
          OWServer Error                  Exception error getting server data: timed out
          OWServer Error                  Error parsing sensor states: Parse() argument 1 must be string or read-only buffer, not None
          OWServer Error                  Trying again in 60 seconds.

- Continue to refine devices.xml <ValueType>...

- Grab changes to plugin config dialog (besides pref poll and debug which
  are already in there. In other words, make sure that any changes that
  are made there are implemented instantly.

- Add facility to update device states when config dialogs are closed.
  Do _NOT_ try to update the device state before it has been fully 
  configured.  For example, calling updateDeviceStates() directly from
  closedDeviceConfigUi() made Indigo very angry.  Perhaps there's a way 
  to trap with dev.configured.

After v1.0:

- Consider bringing in the attributes of variables.  What would that
  look like?

- Only list ROM IDs that are appropriate to the device type being
  created romIdGenerator().

- Add pushPluginPrefs() method like WUnderground.

- Move all convert routines to their own module (and standardize
  between all fogbert plugins.)

- Convert updateDeviceStates() to a dict loop progression?
